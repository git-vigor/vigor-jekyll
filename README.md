Vigor Jekyll site
-----------------

The theme is a gem based Jekyll's default theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Here is a way to connect the `gem` to the local repo so that I don't need to version bump and `bundle install` all of the time...

    bundle config local.vigor-cms-theme /path/to/local/vigor-cms-theme

This reminds me of a chicken parmesan dish. Simple dish with a ton of flavor, the hemp hearts are the “X-factor” with a creamy but crunchy texture that absorbs the flavor.  Adding in the hemp provides a boost of healthy fats and fiber that almost make you feel like you’re eating rice. The spinach soaks up more of the flavor and makes you feel like you have cheese in the dish.

This dish comes together pretty quick because I have my own hot sauce (olive oil, garlic, cayenne, turmeric, lime juice) that I’ll add in with hemp and nutritional yeast.  If you have chicken already prepped – you can throw this together in under 5 mins. 

**Note**: Chicken could be swapped with another protein.

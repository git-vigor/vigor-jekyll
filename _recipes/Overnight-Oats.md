Compared to sugary cereals, overnight oats are a gold mine of nutritional value. Not only do they keep us feeling fuller, longer because of the fiber and protein— they can give us an energy boost to squeeze in morning exercise or get through a marathon meeting at the office. 

**Flavor options:** (Same directions) substitute chocolate flavor protein and cacao for vanilla o+ add teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice

**Notes:** Make sure to stir well. There should be extra liquid, as the oats will have time to absorb.
